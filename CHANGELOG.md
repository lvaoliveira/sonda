# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for the CLI, the configuration
file, the report formats and the public library API.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `sonda scan` analyzes JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java and C/C++ with 31
  rules. See [docs/rules.md](docs/rules.md), which shows noncompliant and
  compliant examples for each rule.
- Metrics: lines of code, comment lines, functions, cyclomatic and cognitive
  complexity, technical debt, and cross-file duplication.
- LCOV coverage import (`--coverage`).
- New-code detection against a git reference (`--new-code`), with every
  metric reported both overall and on new code.
- A configurable quality gate (`[[gate.conditions]]`). Exit codes: 0 when the
  gate passes, 1 when it fails, 2 on errors.
- Text, JSON and SARIF 2.1.0 reports; `--only-new` lists only new issues.
- Suppression comments: `NOSONAR`, `sonda-ignore` and
  `sonda-ignore: rule-id, ...`.
- `sonda rules` and `sonda init` commands.
- `-v`/`-vv`/`-vvv` (or `RUST_LOG`) for structured logs on stderr: phase
  timings, counts, and skipped files.
- A library API: `sonda::run`, `sonda::load_config`, and `sonda::Error`.

### Security

- The analyzed repository is treated as untrusted. sonda never runs `git diff`
  or other commands that can start programs configured in the repository.
  git is limited to object reads.
- `--new-code` references are validated and passed after `--end-of-options`.
- Deeply nested files can no longer overflow the stack. Each file has a size
  cap and a time budget for parsing and rule matching.
- Control characters and bidi overrides from the repository are escaped in
  text reports, errors and logs.
